####Description
Who has time to sit and read the morning paper anymore? Should you make coffee, or turn on the news? Brush your teeth, or catch up on your email? Never worry about making these choices again. We present a new, hands- and eyes-free, voice-based application that will read the news, your email, and the weather to you while you go about your morning schedule. We call it Jeeves. Getting dressed in the morning? Tell Jeeves to read you the latest headlines. Caught in rush hour traffic? Have Jeeves read you your latest emails. Best of all, this app is simple, user-friendly, and free.

####Technology
We used a host of services to bring this project together. Our front- and back-end technologies include HTML5, CSS3 and Twitter Bootstrap, AngularJS, and a little jQuery along with extended Bootstrap UI designs built on top of AngularJS. We turned our code into an Android application with Phonegap, and used Phonegap to access the native speech recognition and text-to-speech systems on the user’s device. To get our news articles, we used a Content API provided by The Guardian. Our original plans involved getting multiple news sources and allowing a user to designate a preferred news source, but we found The Guardian was the only source that provided full articles to developers. But we’ll talk about this more when we get to our future plans. Our weather data is provided to us through a great API from OpenWeatherMap, and our Gmail integration comes from OAuth’s Phonegap SDK to access the recently released Gmail API. We used Git for version control and code collaboration, and, to simplify jobs such as moving files, building our Phonegap application, and configuring the project for release, we fell in love with bash scripts, and they deserve an honorable mention here.
