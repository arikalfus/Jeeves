We started the project by adding the buttons that navigates to the certain pages such as email, news, social media and etc. The we made this pages so that individuals could navigate to these certain pages and have the option to navigate back to the home page. Than we made the database, which caused a little bit of difficulty. We build the database in the computer but it the database is stored in the localhost and cannot be accessed via an ip adress due to the fact that we are using Ubunto that has firewall, but we will overcome this challange soon. However, the database was accurately placed into the application and could be accesed easily via clicking the news RSS feeds. We also converted the app to angular js, which would make it easier to built in the future. Therefore, we have completed all the parts of PA03 and added all the main links and database features to the app.
